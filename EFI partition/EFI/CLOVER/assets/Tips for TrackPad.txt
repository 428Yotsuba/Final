1. Delete `BOOT` folder and `CLOVER` folder in your EFI partition and copy these two folders from this pack.

2. Run `Kext Utility.app`, or type `sudo kextcache -i /` in `Terminal.app`. Then restart.

3. Please go to "System Preferences" - "Trackpad" - "Scroll & Zoom” and uncheck the Smart zoom to let trackpad work perfect.

4. If the trackpad still doesn’t work, try to press F9.

5. The final solution is to boot in Windows and play with the trackpad for a while, then restart into macOS.
