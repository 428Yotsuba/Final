    "text": "Hi there.\n\tAfter struggling by myself to even get 10.14 past the \u0027end randomseed\u0027 line several times I finally found and used your guide to get 10.14.4 installed and working on my hackintosh workstation. I have 10.13.6 stable but not brilliant, it works ok with FCPX and Resolve as I require but can be temperamental.\n\tWithout any Kernal to patch additions I had its power tweaks working and XCPM appeared to work fine. My Radeon Pro WX9100 worked well with the radeon fan speed kext and ran (as per one of the two Luxmark screenshots) at 1442mhz quite successfully.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tI\u2019m up to the part in your guide where your going through SSDT and device implementations. I tried to get XCPM working in 10.14.4 but have given up for the time being. As per the screenshot with the intel power app, and me testing XCPM in terminal and getting 0 back (so not working) it appears that my Xeon is running locked at full clock speed and is reporting wrong. I tried using just the additions to the kernalToPatch that you had in the section but couldn\u2019t get my machine to start so had to go back to the full set I found in the file you shared to another earlier user to get it booting. I\u2019m not sure what is best to tweak to get my v5 Xeon working fully from there. I have the suggested options turned on in bios (and the power one off as recommended) but no joy. If I try the options I used in 10.13.6 (none) then I can\u2019t get it to boot past \u2018end randomseed\u2019\n\n\n\n\tMy other primary concern is my Vega card. My Radeon Pro WX9100 is being reported by Luxmark as running currently on 945mhz. And feels slow in games and FCPX.\n\n\n\n\t\n\tI\u0027ve stuck the\u00a0 VegaTab_9100.kext into the kext folder in clover and also tried adding SSDT-X99-Vega-Fontier.aml (changing the name) but it still feels slow. How might I use the powerplay table to set my WX9100 to 1500mhz and aiming for 55deg Celsius? (I don\u2019t mind a louder card, but I don\u2019t want it too hot as it does long render sessions and long gaming sessions). the Vegatab kext appears to be affecting my fan speed (which is nice) but its not helping the power. If I try running vanilla, I get slow speed 945mhz still.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tI would also like to get my thunderbolt 3 port along with bluetooth \u0026amp; wifi working but will try that once I reach the later part of your guide that deals with it. I\u2019ve never managed to any of those three working so far so they are of less immediate desire.\n\n\n\n\tAudio appears to work perfectly right away. So I\u2019m not keen to touch that.\n\tMy Hard drives and SSD appear okay. Mac OS itself feels to run beautifully smooth. USB 3 is working on most ports and I\u2019m currently leaving the Clixt-iMacPro-AsusX99E-XHCI-15port.kext in there till I put in the time to remake it to suit my systems different layout.https://www.dropbox.com/s/qm9tdbb4amwp3v9/EFI.zip?dl=0 is my EFI folder that\u2019s currently in use. Any help toward getting my processor and graphics working properly would be greatly appreciated. I\u0027ve gone over your guide as best I can, but please let me know if there\u0027s something critical I\u0027ve misunderstood or failed to do.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tEdit, after a while of gaming it starts to freeze repeatedly so I\u0027m continuing the evenings gaming in 10.13 ...\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n",

	<b style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;text-align:left;"><span>Abstract and Introduction:&nbsp;</span></b><br><br style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;text-align:left;"><span style="background-color:#fcfcff;text-align:left;"><font color="#131313"><span style="font-size:14px;">This
 originating post constitutes an innovative and brand new&nbsp;iMac Pro 
macOS 10.14&nbsp;Mojave Build and Desktop Guide for Broadwell-E/EP, 
Haswell-E/EP and&nbsp;X99, which certainly will further grow not 
only&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:14px;">thanks&nbsp;to your 
estimated feedback and&nbsp;contributions. It is the logical 
continuation of my&nbsp;successful&nbsp;iMac Pro Broadwell-E/EP, 
Haswell-E/EP and&nbsp;X99 Build and&nbsp;Desktop Guide published for 
macOS&nbsp;High Sierra 10.13 in the other forum. Being an iMac Pro 
Desktop Guide, it has also large similarities with my <a href="https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/334343-imac-pro-x299-live-the-future-new-with-macos-1014-mojave-successful-buildsuccessful-guide/" rel="">Skylake-X/X299 iMac Pro macOS 10.14 Mojave Desktop Guide</a>.&nbsp;</span></font></span><span style="background-color:#fcfcff;text-align:left;"><font color="#131313"><span style="font-size:14px;">However,
 to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;jumping back and forth, I will make this guide 
as&nbsp;consistent as the&nbsp;other, which&nbsp;however implies also 
some&nbsp;redundancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span>
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<span style="background-color:#fcfcff;text-align:left;"><font color="#131313"><span style="font-size:14px;">As
 everybody already might know, my Broadwell-E/EP, Haswell-E/EP 
and&nbsp;X99 Desktop Guides base&nbsp;on the ASUS X99-A II. However, 
also other X99 ASUS mainboard models or X99 mainboards of other brands 
might be compatible after likely considering and implementing few 
mandatory modifications. The same states for 
guide&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;with all Broadwell-E/EP 
and&nbsp;Haswell-E/EP&nbsp;CPUs different form the 
i7-6950X&nbsp;employed here.&nbsp;</span></font></span>

			Not every BIOS firmware provided by the different Mainbaord 
manufacturers always accounts for all CPU microcodes distributed by 
Intel. Recently we witnessed for instance along the latest macOS 10.13 
High Sierra distributions and even during the first macOS Mojave 10.14 
distribution a Broadwell/Haswell CPU performance issue (no overclocking)
 in combination with most X99 mainboard implementations to be traced 
back a missing Intel CPU microcode implementation in most of the 
distributed Mainbaord BIOS firmwares. To overcome the OC issue, an Intel
 CPU microcode update within the respective BIOS firmware distributions 
is absolutely vital and mandatory.<span>&nbsp;</span>

			How to perform the Intel CPU microcode update for a given BIOS 
firmware distribution e.g. under Windows 10 is detailed below for the 
ASUS X99-A II 1902 BIOS firmware distribution. The same approach, 
initially provided and described by @michaeljeger (once more many thanks
 from all of us<span>&nbsp;<img alt=":thumbsup_anim:" data-emoticon="" src="iMac%20Pro%20X99%20-%20live%20the%20future%20now%20with%20macOS%2010.14%20Mojave%20[Successful%20Build_Successful%20Guide]%20-%20Page%205%20-%20Installation%20Guides%20-%20InsanelyMac%20Forum_files/default_thumbsup_anim.gif" title=":thumbsup_anim:"></span>) can be applied to any other BIOS Firmware distribution of any mainboard manufacturer.<span>&nbsp;</span>

			&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			a.) From online directory "UEFI BIOS Updater" download und unrar 
"UBU_v1_70_rc12.rar" or any newer distribution to an "UBU" directory on 
your Windows Desktop yet to be created&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			b.) Also download and unrar "mms.tar" from the online directory "UEFI
 BIOS Updater". This will create an "mmt" folder, where from the 
"5.2.0.24" directory you copy "MMTool.exe" to your "UBU" Desktop 
directory<span>&nbsp;</span>
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			c.) Download the latest BIOS firmware distribution for your 
particular mainboard from the respective web page of your mainboard 
manufacturer. In case of the ASUS X99-A II, it is 
X99-A-II-ASUS-1902.CAP. Copy the respective BIOS Firmware file to your 
"UBU" Desktop directory.<span>&nbsp;</span>
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">

			&nbsp;
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			d.) Open a windows terminal, change to the "UBU" Desktop directory and launch the UBU software with the terminal command:
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			<span>&nbsp;</span>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>
		</div>

		<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
			On UBU software launch, UBU will now scan your BIOS firmware file 
that you previously added to your "UBU" Desktop directory and detect 
BIOS platform, manufacturer and mainboard model, as well as EFI Driver 
and OROM components.

			By this, the UBU tool will save the modified BIOS firmware file in 
the "UBU" desktop directory already with the correct EZ Flashback 
convention. For mainboards different from ASUS, this last step might be 
different though. We have to wait on further user feedback.&nbsp; In 
case of our ASUS X99-A II 1902 BIOS firmware, we will find X99A2.CAP as 
the result of the UBU Intel CPU microcode procedure.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>

			On a real Mac with native OSX XCPM power management, the MSR 0xE2 
register is unlocked and therefore writeable. However, on ASUS mobos 
this register is usually read only. This is also the case for all ASUS 
X99 mobos. When the kernel tries to write to this locked register, it 
causes a kernel panic. This panic can happen very early in the boot 
process, with the result that your system freezes or reboots during the 
boot process. We can circumvent the MSR 0xE2 register write with a 
dedicated KernelToPatch entry in the config.plist, namely 
"xcpm_core_scope_msrs © Pike R. Alpha" and by enabling the "KernelPM" in
 the config.plist in Section "Kernel and Kext Patches" of the Clover 
Configurator. See Section E.1) for further details.

			However, thanks to CodeRush's Longsoft UEFIPatch distribution and 
sophisticated MSR 0xE2 Register patches, we are able to successfully 
patch any ASUS X99 mainboard BIOS distribution and unlock the MSR 0xE2 
register. This makes the "xcpm_core_scope_msrs © Pike R. Alpha" 
KernelToPatch entry obsolete and allows full native read/write MSR 0xE2 
register access by the OSX kernel. The patched ASUS mainboard BIOS 
firmware finally can be uploaded each specific ASUS X99 mainboard by 
means of the ASUS EZ BIOS Flashback Procedure.

though: when connecting a Vega with e.g. the LG 38UC99-W (WUHD, 3840 pix
 x 1600 pix) via one of the Display Ports (DPs), the screen resolution 
is fine under both Windows 10 and macOS High Sierra but is totally at 
odd during boot (VGA like boot screen resolution). The VEGA DP 4K boot 
screen resolution issue is neither related with the fact that the LG 
38UC99-W is an ultra-wide (3840x1600) and not a true UHD (3840x2160) 
monitor nor related to any likely apparent issue with the ASUS X99-A II 
firmware. It is definitely a Vega firmware problem in combination with 
most 4K displays, as the DP 4K boot screen resolution issue is totally 
absent with any Nvidia GPU and the problem also does not only affect the
 ASUS Splash Screen but also spreads over the entire boot process until 
the login screen is reached (Windows and macOS). Splash Screen, Apple 
logo or verbose boot messages are not stretched but rather have VGA like
 resolution. Any fix of the AMD vBIOS would be highly appreciated. It is
 more than disappointing to witness such issues with 600-1000$ GPUs... 
Fortunately, the 4K boot screen issue is restricted to the Vega DP ports
 and likely due to the fact that the LG 38UC99-W only supports DP 1.2. 
Solution: Connect your Vega and your 4K display via the HDMI port. The 
30 Hz HDMI monitor frequency issue under 10.13 is successfully removed 
under Mojave: monitor frequency of 60 Hz with the display connected via 
HDMI (in contrary to 75 Hz via DP).

Nvidia, which has been rejected. I really hope that Nvidia will not 
leave again the respective community without Web Driver support. In the

xxx.40.105 for macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 after a simple patching 
procedure detailed in Section E.2), although the latter Web Driver is 
not really suited for 10.14 and works without hardware

 you opt for an APFS System Disk implementation, try to 
also&nbsp;implement&nbsp;all other disks of&nbsp;your system 
with&nbsp;APFS file format. On systems with APFS disks and non-APFS 
disks, the boot duration will increase, as apsf.efi will perform a fsck 
check of non-AFPS disks (like HFS+ or Fat32) during boot. However, dual 
boot APFS Systems with an NTFS Windows System Disk are not effected by 
the apsf.efi issue, as OSX does not know how to properly deal with NTFS.</span></font>

			Important additional comment for all Vega users with 4K monitors 
though: when connecting a Vega with e.g. the LG 38UC99-W (WUHD, 3840 pix
 x 1600 pix) via one of the Display Ports (DPs), the screen resolution 
is fine under both Windows 10 and macOS High Sierra but is totally at 
odd during boot (VGA like boot screen resolution). The VEGA DP 4K boot 
screen resolution issue is neither related with the fact that the LG 
38UC99-W is an ultra-wide (3840x1600) and not a true UHD (3840x2160) 
monitor nor related to any likely apparent issue with the ASUS X99-A II 
firmware. It is definitely a Vega firmware problem in combination with 
most 4K displays, as the DP 4K boot screen resolution issue is totally 
absent with any Nvidia GPU and the problem also does not only affect the
 ASUS Splash Screen but also spreads over the entire boot process until 
the login screen is reached (Windows and macOS). Splash Screen, Apple 
logo or verbose boot messages are not stretched but rather have VGA like
 resolution. Any fix of the AMD vBIOS would be highly appreciated. It is
 more than disappointing to witness such issues with 600-1000$ GPUs... 
Fortunately, the 4K boot screen issue is restricted to the Vega DP ports
 and likely due to the fact that the LG 38UC99-W only supports DP 1.2. 
Solution: Connect your Vega and your 4K display via the HDMI port. The 
30 Hz HDMI monitor frequency issue under 10.13 is successfully removed 
under Mojave: monitor frequency of 60 Hz with the display connected via 
HDMI (in contrary to 75 Hz via DP).

actively requesting Web Driver development for macOS 10.14 Public Betas 
from Nvidia, which has been rejected. I really hope that Nvidia will not
 leave again the respective community without&nbsp;Web Driver support. 
In the meanwhile, Nvidia GPU users have to live with e.g. patched Web 
Driver xxx.40.105 for macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 after a simple patching 
procedure detailed below, although the latter Web Driver is not really 
suited for 10.14 and works without hardware acceleration.&nbsp;

				<span style="color:#000000;">Macs only enable TRIM for 
Apple-provided solid-state drives they come with. If you upgrade a Mac 
with an aftermarket SSD/NVMe, the Mac won’t use TRIM with it. The same 
applies for SSDs/NVMes used by a Hackintosh. When an operating system 
uses TRIM with a solid-state drive, it sends a signal to the SSD/NVMe 
every time you delete a file. The SSD/NVMe knows that the file is 
deleted and it can erase the file’s data from its flash storage. With 
flash memory, it’s faster to write to empty memory — to write to full 
memory, the memory must first be erased and then written to. This causes
 your SSD/NVMe to slow down over time unless TRIM is enabled. TRIM 
ensures the physical NAND memory locations containing deleted files are 
erased before you need to write to them. The SSD/NVMe can then manage 
its available storage more intelligently.</span>

 means of the OSXWIFI PCIe Adaptor implementation in PCIe Slot-3. I hope
 that by this specific example it rapidly becomes evident that the 
correct PCI Device implementation cannot be outlined for each individual
 "build-in" or "slot-specific" PCI device within this guide. The 
complexity and effort would just exceed by far all available capacities 
and indeed require the implementation of a separate guide and thread in 
addition. I therefore hope on your skills and flexibility to extend and 
apply the approach and methodology detailed above to any other 
"build-in" or "slot-specific" PCI device yet to be adopted or 
implemented</span>

 is strongly recommend to perform a stepwise SSDT PCI Device 
implementation, starting with one single specific PCI device. Once this 
PCI device has been successfully implemented, another SSDT PCI Device 
module can be added and verified. In case that the implementation of a 
specific PCI Device would be erroneous and fail, it would simply 
disappear from Section "PCI" of Apple's System report. To facilitate the
 stepwise PCI device implementation, the former SSDT-X99-iMacPro.aml has
 been split into separated modules now forming part of my<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://github.com/KGP/X99-System-SSDTs" rel="external nofollow noopener" style="background-color:transparent;color:#1a0dab;font-size:14px;" target="_blank">X99-System-SSDTs Github repository</a><span style="background-color:#fcfcff;color:#000000;font-size:14px;">.</span>

		Note that each SSDT contains a DefinitionBlock entry and the 
underlying PCI device implementation. In case of necessary 
modifications/adaptations, don't forget to also modify/adapt the 
respective DefinitionBlock entries in concordance with your IOREG 
entries. The entire SSDT structure is now completely module like. Each 
module can be independently added, changed or removed in dependence of 
your specific build, needs and requirements. A stepwise implementation 
of the individual PCI device modules is highly recommended!

		The above default Vega PCI device implementation performs an OC of an 
air-flow Nitro+ Vega 64 GPU of up to 1630 Mhz while considering an IDLE 
fan speed of 1500 Mhz. This seems sufficient to remain with GPU temps of
 about 80 deg C under GPU load conditions (e.g. Valley Benchmark), while
 not exceeding any comfortable noise level.

		Everybody can change the respective Vega properties by means of 
VGTab-en.app, which provides a modified "PP_PhmSoftPowerPlayTable" 
(output-file VegaTab_64_data.txt), which can replace the 
"PP_PhmSoftPowerPlayTable", currently implemented in my 
SSDT-X99-Vega.aml distribution. E.g. users with a water-blocked Nitro+ 
Vega 64 like myself want to further screw the max. GPU OC frequencies, 
etc, while others might want to further improve the fan speed behaviour 
on air-flow Vegas..

		As already mentioned before, within my current Vega SSDT PCI device 
implementation, all available ports on the Gigabyte Vega 64 (3x HDMI, 3x
 DP), including multi-monitor support and display hot plug are 
automatically and successfully implemented. However, it seems that 
DP-port issues (black screen) remain, when employing the respective Vega
 SSDT PCI device implementation on Sapphire Nitro+ Vega 64 (2x HDMI, 
2xDP) or ASUS Strix Vega 64 (2x HDMI, 2x DP, 1x DVI) GPUs, which only 
can be removed by adding Whatevergreen.kext v.1.2.1. Within such 
configuration, multi-monitor support and display hot plug can be fully 
achieved also in case of the latter custom Vegas (both 10.13.6 SU and 
10.14.1). Whatevergreen.kext only seems required for all Vegas 
possessing less than 6 physical ports (including the original Vegas like
 Frontier and Vega 64), else the current Vega SSDT PCI device 
implementation does pretty well it's job, including sleep/wake.&nbsp;

with the THB_C connected. For HotPlug with the other TB adaptors, the

				Based on the ideas and instructions of @Matthew82, I achieved an iMacPro ASUS Boot Splash Screen
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				by means of the following procedure:
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				1.) Installation of the BREW distribution:
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				a.) Open a terminal and change to "bash" shell.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted"><span class="pln">bash</span></pre>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				b.) Now enter the following "bash" terminal command and follow the standard BREW installation instructions:
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted"><span class="pln">/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</span></pre>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				2.) After the successful installation of the BREW distribution, we 
have to implement the QT5 distribution, again by using a "bash" terminal
 shell. Enter the following "bash" terminal commands:
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted"><span class="pln">brew install qt5</span></pre>

				<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted"><span class="pln">brew link qt5 --force</span></pre>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				3.) After successfully implementing BREW and QT5 and if not already 
performed in Section B.1), we can now download the actual CodeRush 
UEFIPatch distribution from Github to our home directory with the 
following terminal command:
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted"><span class="pln">git clone https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool</span></pre>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				4.) Now compile the UEFI Tool distribution with the following terminal commands:
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				<pre class="ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted"><span class="pln">cd /UEFITools/
qmake uefitool.pro
make</span></pre>

				<p>
					&nbsp;
				</p>
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				5.) Download and unzip<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W88iCCugipjPgQmz2gmXxBIaHJNv0Muu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">iMacPro.raw</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to your Desktop.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				6.) Now launch by UEFITool by clicking on the newly compiled UEFITool.app in the UEFITools Folder in your home directory.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				a.) Select "File" -&gt; "Open image file" and load your patched or unpatched BIOS Firmware distribution.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				Select "Search.." in the UEFITool "Edit" Menu and perform a "GUID" 
search of "7BB28B99-61BB-11D5-9A5D-0090273FC14D" with "Header only"...
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				You will receive a message "<i>GUID pattern "7BB28B99-61BB-11D5-9A5D-0090273FC14D" found as .... in<span>&nbsp;</span><i>7BB28B99-....</i></i>". Double click on that message and search for the "Raw section" accompanying the "<i>7BB28B99-....</i>"
 entry, which indeed is the Boot Image, which you can easily verify by 
extracting the raw section body (right-click on "Raw section" and select
 "Extract body") to your Desktop and by subsequently opening the 
extracted raw-file directly with Apple's "Preview.app" (right-click an 
the raw file and select "Open with.." -&gt; Preview.app).
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				b.) To exchange the default original ASUS Boot Logo image file 
stored in "Raw Section" by the iMacPro.raw image file that you 
previously downloaded to your Desktop,&nbsp; right-click again on "Raw 
section", select this time "Replace body"&nbsp; and select the 
iMacPro.raw image file on your Desktop.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				<a href="https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/uploads/monthly_2018_06/UefiTool.png.757acdabe4f1de99964ad83bc9fb30a6.png" title="Enlarge image" data-ipslightbox="" data-ipslightbox-group="g18012"><img alt="UefiTool.png.757acdabe4f1de99964ad83bc9fb30a6.png" data-fileid="300350" src="iMac%20Pro%20X99%20-%20live%20the%20future%20now%20with%20macOS%2010.14%20Mojave%20[Successful%20Build_Successful%20Guide]%20-%20Page%205%20-%20Installation%20Guides%20-%20InsanelyMac%20Forum_files/UefiTool.png" class="ipsImage_thumbnailed"></a></div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				Note that the actual image dimension of iMacPro.raw (2131pix x 
1457pix) was adopted for its use on my 38" LG 38UC99. For monitors with 
reduce screen resolution, iMacPro.raw might have to be adopted to an 
image dimension that suites your particular screen resolution, before 
its upload to "Raw section". If the Boot Logo image dimension is too big
 for your Monitor's screen resolution, you might just end up with a 
black screen during the BIOS initialisation at boot.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				To do so, select in the Preview.app Menu -&gt; "Tools" -&gt; "Adjust
 Size". Change the image dimension and save the modified image with 
"File" -&gt; "Export". In the "Export menu" press "Save", after 
selecting "JPEG" under "Format" , after choosing "Desktop" as the place 
to store the image, and after entering the new file name, which has to 
end with ".jpg".
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				Double-check by right-clicking on the resulting jpg image file and 
selecting "Get Info" that its file size does no exceed 200KB by far. If 
the latter would be the case, you would not be able to save the modified
 BIOS Firware file subsequently.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				Finally just rename your new "XXXX.jpg" file to "XXXX.raw....
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				I guess, that by following the procedure detailed above, it is 
obvious that iMacPro.raw also can be substituted by any other image of 
your personal choice. Just be aware that it's background colour should 
be black (ecstatic reason for a its nice integration within the else 
black ASUS BIOS Boot Screen)
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				c.)&nbsp; After replacing "Raw Section" with iMacPro.raw or the 
XXX.raw image of your choice, save your modified BIOS Firmware File with
 the Option "File" -&gt; "Save Image File..."
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				d.) Copy your modified BIOS Firmware file to a USB3.0 Flash Drive, formatted with FAT32.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				e.) Reboot, enter the Mainboard BIOS and save your BIOS settings to the USB Flash Drive
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				f.) Flash your mainboard BIOS with the modified BIOS Firmware
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				g.) Renter the Mainboard BIOS and restore your BIOS settings from the USB Flash Drive
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				h.) Save your restored BIOS settings with (F7) and (F10), reboot and you are done.
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				&nbsp;
			</div>

			<div style="color:#131313;font-size:14px;padding:0px;">
				Just don't forget to set BIOS Setting "Boot Logo Display" to "<span style="color:#000000;">Auto", when using this new approach. Any different setting might result in a black screen during BIOS initialisation.</span>

modified the Kozlek/Interferenc&nbsp;Source Code distribution locally to
 also support GPU Temp sensor information for all Vegas and the new 
Radeon VII. In my recent 10.14 X99 EFI-Folder distributions, the 
resulting FakeSMC.kext and HWSensor.kexts supporting all Vegas already 
have been implemented by default in /EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other. The actual 
10.14.5 Beta X99 EFI-Folder distribution contains FakeSMC.kext and 
HWSensor.kexts also supporting the new Radeon VII.</strong>

flawless stability. Now with macOS 10.14 Mojave, it might be another 
opportunity&nbsp;to follow my iMac Pro Build and Desktop Guide to unfold
 the unbelievable Broadwell-E/EP, Haswell-E/EP, X99 potential!</span></font>

			<font color="#000000"><span style="font-size:14px;">High-end builds 
based on Broadwell-E/EP, Haswell-E/EP, X99 technology have found 
manifold application, not only in science and research at universities 
or research institutions, engineering facilities, or medical labs, 
etc... Broadwell-E/EP, Haswell-E/EP, X99 with up to 22&nbsp;cores 
(44&nbsp;threads) and turbo frequencies up to 4.4&nbsp;GHz have made X99
 to a "relatively cheap" but really serious alternative to real iMac 
Pro's and Mac Pro's. The principal intention of my desktop guides is to 
demonstrate, that we are able to build and configure fully functional 
and relatively "low-cost" high-end systems, which go far beyond of what 
Apple is able to offer at present or will be ever able to offer for some
 reasonable pricing. Broadwell-E/EP, Haswell-E/EP, X99 Systems&nbsp;that
 allow&nbsp;the use of all software-packages developed for MacOS, Unix, 
Linux or even Windows at the same time (e.g. think on Vine, Parallels, 
or a dual boot system configuration). The flexibility between different 
mainboards (Asus, Gigabyte, ASRock, MSI, etc.), different 
Broadwell-E/EP, Haswell-E/EP processors, and different RAM memory 
configurations (16-128GB) make such systems&nbsp;affordable for anybody 
(also home office, audio and video editing/production, etc.) and 
allows&nbsp;their&nbsp;perfect adaptation for each specific purpose, 
requirement&nbsp;and available budget. It might not be necessary to 
outline, that current&nbsp;Broadwell-E/EP, Haswell-E/EP, X99 Systems 
perform absolutely stable on a 24/7/365 basis.</span></font>

expert in solar physics, space weather forecast and related

	That's exactly the patch I am using in my EFi-Folder distributions 
anyway.... Stopped working again with 10.14 DP2, despite the updated 
Broadwell-E Performance Kernel patch. No OC with 10.14 DP2 so 
far.&nbsp;BTW... I would not call it EIST Performance fix, as it does 
not work with EIST enabled anyway.&nbsp;

 night.. Does not work at all, as the original performance patch in 
10.14 DP1 also only worked in conjunction with the&nbsp;SMT_scope kernel

also need the pkg_scope kernel patch for successfully booting my X99 
system.

			With patches in 10.13 I have 27K in Geekbench, and in 10.14 with

<p>
	The EFI-Folder in the first post has not been updated yet for 10.14 
DP2. As implemented currently, it provided perfect OC along 10.14 DP1. 
BTW.. similar issues also state for 10.13.6 Beta 2 and 3, while OC was 
working perfectly fine under 10.13.6 Beta 1, just by applying the 
respective performance patches.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	Your current poor benchmark results under 10.14 DP2&nbsp;are in line 
with what we are just discussing right now here 
above..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			The EFI-Folder in the first post has not been updated yet for 10.14 
DP2. As implemented currently, it provided perfect OC along 10.14 DP1. 
BTW.. similar issues also state for 10.13.6 Beta 2 and 3, while OC was 
working perfectly fine under 10.13.6 Beta 1, just by applying the 
respective performance patches.&nbsp;

		<p>
			Your current poor benchmark results under 10.14 DP2&nbsp;are in line 
with what we are just discussing right now here 
above..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>﻿</span>

	10.13 DP1? You mean 10.14 DP1? &nbsp;What about your mainboard BIOS

 or CPU you actually employ.. Difficult to trace back your

	Does this guide work for the X99-A USB 3.1 board as well? I don't know 
if the USB 3.1 edition and the Mk II version (which this article is 
about) would work with the same everything. I'm trying to get my X99-A 
USB 3.1 edition working with Mojave but there's not much info on it. I'd
 rather not squander many more of my scarce hours if i don't have to. 
following this guide alone would take enough time as it is.&nbsp;

	Question: KGP does not tells me to install clover boot loader to the 
usb installer, am I correct? Or do I miss something here? I want to 
update my Asrock X99m Extreme4 hackintosh from El Capitan to Mojave but I
 always have problems with creating the usb installer to boot from. Do I
 really just need to copy the EFI folder decribed in C and D Section to 
the EFI Partition? in the past, clover was always needed for 
bootup.&nbsp;

			Question: KGP does not tells me to install clover boot loader to the 
usb installer, am I correct? Or do I miss something here? I want to 
update my Asrock X99m Extreme4 hackintosh from El Capitan to Mojave but I
 always have problems with creating the usb installer to boot from. Do I
 really just need to copy the EFI folder decribed in C and D Section to 
the EFI Partition? in the past, clover was always needed for 
bootup.&nbsp;

			Hi,KGP. I'm back. I have a supermico board x10dai, with dual E5

the performance patches but none of them&nbsp;&nbsp;did work.&nbsp; 
XCPM&nbsp; does not registered. Can you help me ? Here is all my files.
